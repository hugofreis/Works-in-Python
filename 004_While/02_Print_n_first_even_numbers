# This function receives as an argument the number n of numbers you want to obtain and prints a list of the n first even whole numbers in existence.

def PrintEvenNums(n):

    listofnums = []
    
    num = 0 If you wished instead to print the x first odd whole numbers, all you would have to change in the code would be to change this starting value of "num" from 0 to 1.
    
    while( len(listofnums) < n):
       listofnums.append(num)
       num = num + 2
    
    print(listofnums)

PrintEvenNums(10)
